Kathmandu Valley is increasingly plagued by frequent road collapses, attributed to disorganised development projects. According to Narayan Datt Bhandari, Chief of the Division Road Office, the uncoordinated development efforts, particularly with underground utilities, have led to a rise in sinkholes across the valleyâ€™s roads.

On Wednesday, a significant sinkhole appeared on the inner road connecting Imadol via the New Bridge-Bhojepokhari route in Mahalaxmi Municipality-3, Lalitpur. The sinkhole, approximately three meters wide, disrupted traffic flow, especially during office hours, causing delays. Lalitpur Police spokesperson, SP Nareshraj Subedi, reported that the cause of the road collapse is still unknown.
This incident follows a series of road collapses across the valley. Last Thursday, a massive sinkhole developed on Kamaladi Road near Kathmandu Plaza. The Division Road Office attributes this collapse to a failed brick support under a culvert over the Tukucha River. The road, now blocked, is expected to take up to three months for complete repair, as a new culvert needs to be constructed.

Three days earlier, two large sinkholes appeared on Shivalaya Road in Kirtipur Municipality-10 after a sewer line burst, causing soil erosion. Local activist Birendra Shakya blamed the collapse on overloading the drainage system with excess water. Kirtipur has been experiencing a rise in similar incidents, with some roads being temporarily patched by local authorities.On June 30, a motorcyclist and his bike fell into a massive sinkhole on the Sorhakhutte-Balaju road section. Rescuers had to use cranes and water pumps to retrieve the bike. The collapse was caused by a leak in the underground water pipes managed by the Kathmandu Valley Drinking Water Limited (KUKL).

In another incident on January 26, a bus traveling along the Baneshwor-Maitighar road section sank into a collapsed area. Investigation revealed gaps between underground sewage pipes as the cause. Earlier, in November 2021, another large sinkhole appeared on the road near Civil Hospital in Baneshwor, similarly caused by underground utility failures.
